# Pressroom

**This just in: your story's already written.**

Pressroom is an AI-powered marketing content engine. It monitors signal sources (Hacker News, Reddit, GitHub, RSS), identifies relevant stories, and generates ready-to-publish content across multiple channels — blog posts, LinkedIn, X threads, newsletters, and email drafts.

Think of it as a wire room for your marketing team. Signals come in, content goes out.

## How It Works

```
Sources (HN, Reddit, GitHub, RSS, Web)
        │
        ▼
   ┌─────────┐
   │  SCOUT   │  ← pulls signals from configured sources
   └────┬────┘
        ▼
   ┌─────────┐
   │  WIRE    │  ← signal triage: prioritize, spike, or curate into stories
   └────┬────┘
        ▼
   ┌──────────┐
   │ GENERATE  │  ← Claude writes content using signals + voice + angle
   └────┬─────┘
        ▼
   ┌──────────┐
   │ HUMANIZE  │  ← strips AI tells, matches brand voice
   └────┬─────┘
        ▼
   ┌──────────┐
   │  QUEUE    │  ← approve, edit, schedule, or spike
   └────┬─────┘
        ▼
   ┌──────────┐
   │ PUBLISH   │  ← push to LinkedIn, HubSpot, blog, or copy to clipboard
   └──────────┘
```
